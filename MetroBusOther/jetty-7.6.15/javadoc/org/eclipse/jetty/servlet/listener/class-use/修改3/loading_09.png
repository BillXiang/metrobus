apeutics Society (ESCoNS)  meeting in San Francisco, L=
umosity scientists presented data from over  80,000 members who trained wit=
h Word Bubbles. Members in their 20s and 30s had identical verbal fluency b=
aselines; even members in their 40s and 50s experienced less of a decline i=
n verbal fluency baselines compared to decline in other core functions.</p>=
                                                         <p>This  study sho=
wed that every group, regardless of age and baseline scores,  improves&nbsp=
;significantly&nbsp;after training with Word Bubbles. This comes as  good n=
ews to anybody who's had a tip-of-the-tongue moment or knows a  term paper =
is coming up: no matter who you are, you can improve your verbal  fluency p=
erformance with training.</p>                                              =
           <p>Improving verbal fluency isn't just about a glib tongue, howe=
ver. Verbal fluency is  often used as a metric in neuropsychological batter=
ies for  crystallized intelligence, or how well you can access and use  inf=
ormation stored in long-term memory. Crystallized intelligence improves thr=
oughout one's lifespan&mdash;meaning that trained improvements will stick w=
ith you.</p>
